    "description": "At SLTC Research University, I pursued a BSc (Hons) in Cloud Computing. My journey through the program allowed me to explore a wide range of topics including cloud infrastructure, software engineering, cybersecurity, data analytics, AI, and machine learning. I gained hands-on experience building scalable systems, designing secure applications, and integrating cloud technologies in real-world projects. The curriculum emphasized practical application of theoretical knowledge, fostering problem-solving, analytical thinking, and collaboration skills. Participating in lab exercises, workshops, and team projects enhanced my technical capabilities and prepared me for a professional career in technology. Beyond technical skills, the program developed my communication, project management, and critical thinking abilities. I actively engaged in extracurricular activities, contributing to clubs and student communities, which further honed my leadership and teamwork skills. This comprehensive academic experience laid a solid foundation for my growth as a full stack and cloud computing professional, equipping me to tackle complex technical challenges and innovate solutions that have meaningful impact in the digital world.",
